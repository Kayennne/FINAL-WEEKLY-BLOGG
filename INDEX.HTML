        <p> This week is self learning!!!</p>
        <p> Not gonna lie the chapter 5 was very confusing, but this week I learnt more in depth on making classes and function in javascript,
            there were thing about constants and all that kind of things, learnt to code in the browser console as weel, like using the console to
            see things like documents all
        </p>
        <p> Overall managed to follow the exercises and do some of the practices</p>
        <p> Also downloaded some extentions that really is of great help to me when coding</p>


        <h2>Week 6 blog</h2>
        <p> This week, we kind of used python to code in replit</p>

        <h2>Week 7 blog</h2>
